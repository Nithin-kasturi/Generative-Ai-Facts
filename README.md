Generative-AI-Facts-Generator

Welcome to my Facts Generator app repository! This project demonstrates my use of React Native for mobile development, MongoDB for authentication, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

Currently, I’m learning how to integrate Generative AI by Groq to generate relevant facts based on user search inputs. This feature brings a cutting-edge element to the app and showcases my exploration into AI-driven solutions.

Explore the code and contributions, and let’s discuss any feedback or ideas you may have!
